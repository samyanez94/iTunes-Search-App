# iTunes Search App
Sixth app of the [Treehouse iOS Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ios-development).

This app searches for an artist in the iTunes Library and lets the users browse its collection of albums and tracks. Built as a way to get more familiar with UITableViews and networking calls in iOS.

The app uses the [iTunes Seach API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) to retrieve artist, album, and song data.
