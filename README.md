# iTunes Search App

I decided to build this app as a way to get more familiar working with UITableViews and networking calls in iOS. The app searches for artists in the iTunes Library and lets the users browse its collection of albums and tracks.

To do this, the app uses the [iTunes Seach API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) to retrieve artist, album, and song data. The endpoint to perform the request is modeled after the user input received from an UISearchBar.

As I built this app, I learned a lot about modeling complex endpoints, URL parameter encoding, concurrent downloads using operation queues, and displaying JSON data using a table view.
